## Supplemental Data:


- Supplemental Table 1: QC metrics for 10x WGS
- Supplemental Table 2.For 20 ChIP-seq datasets, the percentage of reads which were mapped to the reference genome when using a linear genome (Linear) or a personalized graph genome (Graph) for donor 1 and donor 2.
- Supplemental Table 3: Reproducibility of ASB within each donor and between donors at different p-value thresholds
- Supplemental Table 4: ASB variants. Summary of all ASB variants with a nominal p-value <0.05. Positive log2FC indicates a preference for the ALT allele
- Supplemental Table 5: Significant predicted alterations to motifs by ASB variants using motifbreakR
- Supplemental Table 6: Results from LDSC analysis
- Supplemental Table 7: GWAS sum stats used for LDSC analysis
- Supplemental Table 8: RNA counts from donor1 for highlighted example in Figure 5.
