# Allele specific transcription factor binding across human brain regions offers mechanistic insight into eQTLs
Transcription Factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by facilitating or disrupting the formation of transcription initiation machinery at particular genomic loci. Since TF occupancy is driven in part by recognition of DNA sequence, genetic variation can influence TF-DNA associations and gene regulation. To identify variants that impact TF binding in human brain tissues, we assessed allele specific binding (ASB) at heterozygous variants for 94 TFs in 9 brain regions from two donors. Leveraging graph genomes constructed from phased genomic sequence data, we compared ChIP-seq signals between alleles at heterozygous variants within each brain region and identified thousands of variants exhibiting ASB for at least one TF, with ASB reproducibility measured by comparisons between independent experiments both within and between donors. We found that rarer alleles in the general population more frequently led to reduced TF binding, whereas common variation had an equal likelihood of increasing or decreasing binding. Motif analysis revealed TF-specific effects, with ASB variants for certain TFs displaying a greater incidence of motif alterations, as well as enrichments for variants under purifying selection. Notably, neuron-specific cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) showed depletion for ASB variants. We identified 2,670 ASB variants with prior evidence of allele-specific gene expression in the brain from GTEx data and observed increasing eQTL effect direction concordance as ASB significance increases. These results provide a valuable and unique resource for mechanistic analysis of cis-regulatory variation in human brain tissue.
